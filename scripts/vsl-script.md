## [HOOK - 0:00-0:30]

The AI job drought is coming.

Not in 5 years. Not in 3 years. It's already happening.

Amazon laid off 15,000 employees in 2025. Microsoft cut 10,000. And that's just the beginning.

I manage a team of 40+ engineers at OpenAI, the largest AI company in the world. We spend millions of dollars a month on world-class engineers.

I'm going to teach you exactly what separates the engineers we fight to keep from the ones we let go.

---

## [PROBLEM - 0:30-1:30]

Here's what's happening right now, whether you want to see it or not:

Junior developers with AI skills are shipping faster than senior engineers without them.

Your 10 years of experience? It's becoming a liability, not an asset.

You've probably noticed it. Your AI-generated code works, but it's not production-grade. You're constantly fixing, refactoring, debugging things that shouldn't have broken. Then you say screw it, I'll code it myself properly. But that's where you're missing out on the superpowers of using your existing software development knowledge combined with the correct system to multiply your productivity without sacrificing code quality.

Meanwhile, engineers who've mastered agentic development are building complete applications in hours. They're launching SaaS products on weekends. They're commanding salaries of $200,000 to $500,000 a year.

And every hour you spend manually coding is an hour someone else is using to ship 10 times more than you.

The gap widens daily.

## [WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY - 1:30-2:30]

But here's what nobody is telling you:

Right now, maybe 1% of engineers have true agentic development skills.

That means right now, you can command astronomical rates. You can charge what you want. Companies are desperate for engineers who actually know how to work with AI at a production level.

And I can tell you this, because for our team at OpenAI we literally cannot find people with these skills, we're interviewing and hiring like crazy, and we still can't hire as many people as we need, because no one has these skills yet.

But this window is closing fast.

In 1 to 2 years, everyone will have these skills. The premium disappears.

Think about it: would you rather learn this now, when it gives you a massive competitive advantage? Or later, when you're just catching up to the baseline?

This is the most valuable skill a software engineer can learn in 2026. And the best time to learn it is right now.

## [SOLUTION REVEAL - 2:30-3:30]

That's why I created The Advanced Cursor Mastery Course.

This isn't a beginner tutorial. This is the exact cursor workflows, rules files, prompts and settings we use to ship dozends of internal applications at OpenAI and hundreds of applications with my agency. This is what I require every engineer on my team to watch.

It takes you from mid-to-senior level engineer to world-class Agentic Development Architect.

Here's what changes:

You stop using AI as a helper and start using it as your main engineer.

You stop typing code manually and start directing agents to execute.

You stop building one feature at a time and start running multiple AI agents in parallel - getting team-level output as a solo engineer.

For the first time in history, one person can build what used to require entire teams. Any idea. Any scale. In hours, not months.

If you can think it, cursor can build it.

## [PROOF - 3:30-4:30]

Don't take my word for it. Look at what I've built with this exact system:

RealGreatDevs - a platform with over 2 million software engineers.

BusinessOS - a full business automation platform with a beautiful GSAP-powered landing page.

ReviveDeadLinks - a bootstrapped SaaS that was profitable within 7 days.

This landing page you're looking at right now? Built entirely with Cursor 2.0 and the techniques taught in this course.

Here's what students are saying:

Sarah, a mid-level developer: "I went from struggling with AI tools to shipping a complete SaaS in 3 days. I still can't believe it."

Marcus, a senior engineer at a FAANG company: "I used these techniques to 10x my output. Got promoted to Staff 6 months later."

James, a founder: "I built my entire MVP in a weekend. My investors thought I had a team of 5."

## [VALUE STACK - 4:30-5:30]

Here's everything you get:

The complete 8-module Agentic Development System - the full methodology used by OpenAI engineers daily.

Full source code of a production website analytics SaaS product - complete with Stripe integration, admin panel, and MCP server. Built live on the course using Cursor alone.

Production-ready Cursor Rules Library - pre-built rules files used in enterprise environments.

Lifetime updates and all future content - stay current as Cursor evolves.

The total value? Over $168,000, considering the salary increases, the products you'll ship, and the career trajectory you'll gain.

One-time payment. Lifetime access.

Look - the question isn't whether you can afford the price tag, if you're a mid-to-senior level engineer, of course you can afford it.

The question is whether you can afford NOT to learn this.

Because by not learning agentic development, you're missing out on hundreds of thousands of dollars over the next 12 months. You're watching junior developers get promoted over you. You're risking your job to someone with real AI skills.
