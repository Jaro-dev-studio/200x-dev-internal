# 200x.dev - Next.js Application

• Code Style

- Write concise, technical TypeScript code
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError)
- Don't repeat functionality or code
- Keep code organized and consistent across the codebase
- Keep components focused and composable
- Use the cn() utility for conditional classNames
- Every page.tsx page should be a server component, and do data fetching if needed
- Always return data from fetchers and actions in following format: `{ data: (type of data) | null, error: string | null }`
- Always wrap fetchers and actions within try-catch block

• Folder Structure

- All actions should be defined within /actions folder
- All fetchers should be defined within /fetchers folder
- Use lowercase with dashes as file naming convensions for both actions and fetchers
- All forms should be defined within /components/forms folder
- All modals should be defined within /components/modals folder
- Layout components should be defined within /components/layout folder
- All configuration files must be defined within /config folder
- All constant data must be defined within /constants folder
- All custom hooks must be defined within /hooks folder
- Client-side environment variables types starting with NEXT_PUBLIC must be defined in /env/client.ts
- Server-side environment variables types must be defined in /env/server.ts
- Always add css/scss files to /styles folder
- Always add any third-party providers to /providers folder and use it in /providers/index.tsx file
- Always use server actions, avoid API routes unless necessary (e.g. for webhooks)

• Naming Conventions

- All components should go in /components and be named like new-component.tsx
- Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/auth-wizard)
- Don't define custom components within /ui folder.
- Favor named exports for components

• TypeScript Usage

- Use TypeScript for all code
- Prefer interfaces over types

• UI and Styling

- Always use CSS variable-based colors (primary, secondary, accent, background, etc.)
- Never hardcode hex colors - use Tailwind classes that map to CSS variables
- Always use colors from tailwind.config.js, without opacity variants i.e. bg-background instead of bg-background/40
- Use mobile-first approach for responsive design
- Use Tailwind responsive prefixes (sm:, md:, lg:) for breakpoints
- Test all layouts on mobile viewport
- Make sure everything you produce is mobile-friendly
- Avoid customizing base components with className unless necessary, i.e. <Card/> instead of <Card className="blah blah blah">
- Don't change element sizes on hover
- Don't use gradients
- Keep UI consistent across pages
- In dialogs the cancel button should be on the right, the action button on the left, only ever have max 2 buttons in a dialog
- Use modern UI/UX design patterns

• Performance Optimization

- Minimize re-renders

• Animations

- Use Tailwind transitions for simple effects
- Use Framer Motion for complex animations
- Keep animations subtle and professional

• Accessibility and Content

- Include proper semantic HTML
- Ensure accessibility (alt texts, ARIA labels)
- Use realistic placeholder content

• Key Conventions

- Favor server components and Next.js SSR
- Always structure pages as follows: page.tsx for data fetching with inside it a client component which lives in client.tsx in the same directory, loading.tsx for loading state based on client.tsx
- Avoid using space-x and space-y instead use flex and gap e.g. flex flex-row gap-2

use pnpnm
use pnpm lint for linting fixes, do not fix linting errors manually

always use prisma db push, never use prisma db migrate.

Always build at the end of the task and fix build.

If using third party apis, make sure to test the get requests at least to make sure the data being sent is valid and it returns a 200
